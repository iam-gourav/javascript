// oops and class in js  

// oops is a programming paradigm means how you write a code
// someone write function based coding or someone write class based coding
// it is only the process of writing a code

// object
// collection of properties and methods

// properties means variables
// methods means functions 
//methods:- toLowerCaes , etc


// why use oops 

// parts of oops

// object literal


// words we are reading about them
// constructer function
// prototype
// classes
// instance (new , this)

// 4 pillars of oops programming

// abstraction :- means hide the details like methods and properties eg:- fetch

// Encapsulation :- it means wrap all the properties and methods
//                    eg:- we have many functions like sum() , subtract() , multiply() etc
//                    we wrap all the methods in a class we also decide which method is accessable
//                    or not

// Inheritance :- 

// Polymorphism :- poly means many morphism means form
//                 ex:- create a class having method makeSound() and it used by dog and cat
//                 the output of these methods is a real entity objects or instance
